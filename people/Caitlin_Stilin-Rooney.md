With a deep concern for the human condition, Caitlin traveled to Kenya in 2011 to assist the largest East African coffee trading company explore ways to integrate mobile payments into its practice as a means to ensure payment accountability for women coffee farmers.

Working in Kenya provided Caitlin with the practical skills that she would then use in her efforts in Jimaní, a small town along the border of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In Jimaní, Caitlin co-developed COTEDEMI, a local women's organization focused on business development, financial education, and access to legal documentation that individuals need to live, work and travel safely within the Dominican Republic.

While in Jimaní she began working as a consultant to develop and coordinate projects and products for ADOPEM, a Dominican bank founded by women to serve the needs of women. Her efforts resulted in the development of the "Banca Comunal” or Community Bank, a product that provides non-traditional banking customers with an array of financial services.

To strenghten the joint efforts of ADOPEM and COTEDEMI, she facilitated the first pilot group of undocumented individuals living on the border to receive loans. To date, groups have received and are paying back over USD $10,000 in loans.

In 2015, Caitlin joined PingBlip, an e-banking platform designed to generate commercial revenue for small and medium-sized businesses in the Dominican Republic. The plan to create network banking partnerships and distribution centers that would allow remote and low-income communities to promote their businesses in major commercial centers, and to provide a cost effective means of transferring goods and money were the reasons that PingBlip was chosen as a finalist in the social entrepreneurship competition “The Venture” by Chivas.

Caitlin has a deep commitment to social justice as can be seen in her active participation in domestic and international campaigns to promote economic development, to ensure gender equality and to uphold the dignity of immigrants and of vulnerable groups around the globe.
